# Tasks Folder

This folder contains individual task files formatted as GitHub issues to enable seamless integration with GitHub's issue tracking system.

## Workflow

### Creating Tasks
1. Create new task files using the naming convention: `T##-task-name.md` (aligned with project plan)
2. Use the GitHub issue format with all required fields
3. Include clear acceptance criteria and task breakdowns
4. Reference dependencies using T## task numbers from project plan

### GitHub Integration
1. **Import to GitHub**: Task files can be bulk imported to GitHub Issues
2. **Team Collaboration**: Team members add feedback as issue comments in GitHub
3. **Export from GitHub**: Updated issues with comments can be exported back to update project documents
4. **Sync Process**: Regular sync between local task files and GitHub issues maintains consistency

## Task Overview

### Task Definition Pending
*Tasks will be defined after requirements gathering and project planning are complete.*

**Planned Task Categories:**
- **Analysis Tasks**: Process analysis and enhancement opportunity identification
- **Design Tasks**: Enhanced process model design and architecture
- **Development Tasks**: Implementation of process enhancements and integrations
- **Testing Tasks**: Validation and testing of enhanced processes
- **Integration Tasks**: Integration with existing organizational processes
- **Documentation Tasks**: Documentation, training, and deployment preparation

### Task Numbering
- Tasks will be numbered sequentially (T01, T02, T03, etc.)
- Task numbers will align with project plan work breakdown structure
- Dependencies will be tracked using task number references

## File Templates
- **task-template.md**: Standard template for creating new task files
- **task-tracking.md**: Overall task progress and status tracking

## Status Tracking

Task statuses will follow the GitHub issue lifecycle:
- **Open**: Task ready to begin or in progress
- **In Progress**: Task actively being worked on
- **Under Review**: Task completed, awaiting review/approval
- **Closed**: Task completed and verified

## Next Steps

1. Complete requirements gathering and project planning
2. Define specific tasks based on project plan WBS
3. Create task files using the template
4. Import tasks to GitHub Issues for team collaboration
