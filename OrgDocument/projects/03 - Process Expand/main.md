# 03 - Process Expand

## Overview
This project focuses on expanding and enhancing existing organizational processes to support deeper analysis, improved workflows, and enhanced capability maturity. The goal is to extend current process models with advanced features, deeper analysis capabilities, and integration enhancements.

## Structure
- `artifacts/` - Supporting materials and analysis outputs
  - `Requirements/` - Project requirements and specifications
  - `Analysis/` - Technical analysis documents
  - `Changes/` - Requirements change requests and tracking
  - `Sample Data/` - Test data and examples
  - `Testing/` - Test plans and results
  - `UI Mockups/` - Design mockups and wireframes
- `tasks/` - Individual task files in GitHub issue format
  - Task files can be imported to GitHub Issues for team collaboration
  - Feedback added as issue comments in GitHub
  - Issues can be exported from GitHub to update project documents

## Key Documents
- [Project Plan](project-plan.md) - Detailed MVP planning with PERT analysis
- [Tasks Folder](tasks/) - Individual task files in GitHub issue format for team collaboration
- [Analysis artifacts (artifacts/Analysis/)](artifacts/Analysis/) - Technical analysis documents
- [Requirements artifacts (artifacts/Requirements/)](artifacts/Requirements/) - Project requirements and specifications
- [Changes Management](artifacts/Changes/) - Requirements change tracking and documentation
- [Testing artifacts (artifacts/Testing/)](artifacts/Testing/) - Test plans and validation results

## MVP Scope
**Core Objective**: Establish enhanced process expansion capabilities that extend existing organizational processes with advanced analysis, deeper integration, and improved workflow automation.

### MVP Deliverables
1. **Enhanced Process Models**: Advanced process modeling with deeper capability analysis
2. **Workflow Automation**: Automated workflow enhancements for existing processes
3. **Integration Framework**: Enhanced integration capabilities between process elements
