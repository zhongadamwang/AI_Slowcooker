# 01 - Building Skills

## Overview
This project's goal is to build the skills needed for evolutionary development process. This is an internal project focused on developing organizational capabilities and methodologies to support adaptive software development practices.

## Structure
- `artifacts/` - Supporting materials and analysis outputs
  - `Requirements/` - Project requirements and specifications
  - `Analysis/` - Technical analysis documents
  - `Changes/` - Requirements change requests and tracking
  - `Sample Data/` - Test data and examples
  - `UI Mockups/` - Design mockups and wireframes
- `tasks/` - Individual task files in GitHub issue format
  - Task files can be imported to GitHub Issues for team collaboration
  - Feedback added as issue comments in GitHub
  - Issues can be exported from GitHub to update project documents

## Key Documents
- [Initial Requirements](artifacts/Requirements/initial-requirements.md) - Project scope and high-level requirements
- [MVP Project Plan](project-plan.md) - Detailed MVP planning with PERT analysis
- [Tasks Folder](tasks/) - Individual task files in GitHub issue format for team collaboration
- [Changes Management](artifacts/Changes/) - Requirements change tracking and documentation  
- [Analysis artifacts (artifacts/Analysis/)](artifacts/Analysis/) - Technical analysis documents
- [Requirements Process Description](artifacts/Requirements/requirements-process-description.md) - Development process transcript
- [Skill Development Process Model](../../orgModel/01%20-%20Skill%20Development%20Process/main.md) - Process modeling for skill development

## MVP Scope
**Core Objective**: Establish the foundational AI Agent Skills system that can analyze requirements and produce iterative outputs using the GitHub Agent Skills Standard for VS Code.

### MVP Deliverables
1. **12 Working AI Agent Skills**: Requirements analysis and planning skills using skill-creator framework
2. **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Skills optimized for VS Code with GitHub Copilot
3. **Document Management Pipeline**: Markdown-based system for requirements processing
4. **Agent Skills Standard Compliance**: Skills that follow GitHub's Agent Skills Standard

### MVP Success Criteria
- 12 skills can process requirements and generate structured analysis
- Skills integrate seamlessly with VS Code and GitHub Copilot workflow
- Markdown-based workflow maintains document traceability
- Skills follow GitHub Agent Skills Standard
- Process is documented and repeatable for GitHub Copilot users

## Status
- **Phase**: Phase 2 - Domain & Process Skills (In Progress)
- **Last Updated**: February 10, 2026
- **Recent Achievement**: Domain.ExtractConcepts Skill Completed (T5)
- **Next Milestone**: Domain Analysis Skills (T6-T7)
- **Project Type**: Meta-Development (Building the development process itself)
- **Progress**: 8/16 skills completed (50%)
