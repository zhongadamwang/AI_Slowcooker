# 01 - Building Skills

## Overview
This project's goal is to build the skills needed for evolutionary development process. This is an internal project focused on developing organizational capabilities and methodologies to support adaptive software development practices.

## Structure
- `artifacts/` - Supporting materials and analysis outputs
  - `Requirements/` - Project requirements and specifications
  - `Analysis/` - Technical analysis documents
  - `Requirements/` - Detailed requirement specifications
  - `Sample Data/` - Test data and examples
  - `UI Mockups/` - Design mockups and wireframes
- `tasks/` - Individual task files in GitHub issue format
  - Task files can be imported to GitHub Issues for team collaboration
  - Feedback added as issue comments in GitHub
  - Issues can be exported from GitHub to update project documents

## Key Documents
- [Initial Requirements](artifacts/Requirements/initial-requirements.md) - Project scope and high-level requirements
- [MVP Project Plan](project-plan-mvp.md) - Detailed MVP planning with PERT analysis
- [Tasks Folder](tasks/) - Individual task files in GitHub issue format for team collaboration
- [Analysis artifacts (artifacts/Analysis/)](artifacts/Analysis/) - Technical analysis documents
- [Requirements Process Description](artifacts/Requirements/requirements-process-description.md) - Development process transcript
- [Skill Development Process Model](../../orgModel/01%20-%20Skill%20Development%20Process/main.md) - Process modeling for skill development

## MVP Scope
**Core Objective**: Establish the foundational AI Agent Skills system that can analyze requirements and produce iterative outputs.

### MVP Deliverables
1. **Single Working AI Agent Skill**: Requirements analysis skill that can process user input
2. **Basic Feedback Loop**: Request → AI Analysis → Output → Human Review → Refinement cycle
3. **Document Management Pipeline**: Two-document system (raw requirements + model translation)
4. **Self-Validation Process**: AI skill that can test and improve its own outputs

### MVP Success Criteria
- Agent can process a simple requirement and generate structured analysis
- Human can provide feedback that improves subsequent iterations
- System maintains document traceability between requirements and model elements
- Process is documented and repeatable

## Status
- **Phase**: MVP Definition
- **Last Updated**: February 7, 2026
- **Next Milestone**: First Working AI Agent Skill
- **Project Type**: Meta-Development (Building the development process itself)
