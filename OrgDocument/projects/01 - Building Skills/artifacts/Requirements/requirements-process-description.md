**Smoothed Transcript**

The purpose of this project is to build **AI Agent Skills** to help manage the entire software development process—from requirements to analysis, design, project planning, and dynamic adjustment.

This is a complete process. While building these Agent Skills, they will be generated by AI and tested by AI. The project itself serves its own needs.

The process works as follows: as a developer, I propose my needs in the project. The project uses relevant skills to analyze them and transform them into tasks. These tasks are incorporated into the **project management method**.

As a developer, I submit a request. The AI agent invokes the relevant skills to operate, analyze, and produce outputs appropriate to the current step. I review the outputs. If they do not meet my expectations, I provide feedback, and the AI agent incorporates the feedback and adjusts the results.

Once I confirm that a result is acceptable, the AI agent moves on to the next step of work. Following the software engineering methods we define, the results are generated within our corporate organization model.

We will maintain a document folder with two documents: the requirements provided in the project, and a translation of those requirements into model elements. This is the general process of the project.

As the project proceeds, we will gradually strengthen it. I want this process to be adaptable so we can continuously meet requirements and make timely adjustments. This is how we manage the project—dynamically—reflecting the reality of software development: at the start, we have a relatively rough, large-scale vision; as development deepens, we refine and adjust details around that vision, and project management is updated accordingly.

This is why we want to carry out an AI Agent Skills development project.
