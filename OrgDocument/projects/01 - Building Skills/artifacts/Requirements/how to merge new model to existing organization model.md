The Evolutionary Development Process (EDP) is a framework for software development that emphasizes adaptability and continuous improvement. When merging a new model into an existing organization model, it is crucial to follow a structured approach to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption. Here are the steps to effectively merge a new model into an existing organization model:
1. **Assess the Current Model**: The current model is retained in the orgModel folder in a process breakdown hierarchy. Under each process folder, the sub-model is described in domain-model.md, process.md, collaboration.md, state-machine.md, main.md, vocabulary.md, and test-case-list.md. The details description is in the /instructions.md file. 

Each message in the collaboration.md file can be mapped to a sub-process folder in the orgModel folder. The sub-process folder contains the domain model, process model, collaboration model, state machine model, main model, vocabulary model, and test case list for that specific sub-process. This structure allows for a clear and organized representation of the existing organization model, making it easier to identify areas that may be impacted by the new model.

2. **Identify the New Model**: By using the analysis skills and change management skills, the new requirements can be modeled in same way as the existing model. This involves creating new domain models, process models, collaboration models, state machine models, main models, vocabulary models, and test case lists for the new requirements. However, the change might not be in the same granular level as the existing organization model. The new requirements might be at a higher level of abstraction, such as a new business process or a new organizational structure. In this case, it is important to identify the specific areas of the existing model that will be impacted by the new requirements and determine how they will be integrated.

3. **Plan the Integration**: Once the new model has been identified, it is important to plan how it will be integrated into the existing organization model. This involves determining the sequence of steps that will be taken to merge the new model, identifying any potential conflicts or issues that may arise during the integration process, and developing a strategy for addressing these issues. It is also important to communicate the integration plan to all stakeholders involved in the process to ensure that everyone is aware of the changes that will be made and how they will be implemented. The approach is to find out the minimum sub-process model which matches the new model maximum process by domain entities. Then, the new model can be merged into the existing model by replacing the identified sub-process model with the new model. This approach allows for a more seamless integration of the new model into the existing organization model while minimizing disruption to existing processes and workflows. The changes identified can be used to generate the tasks for the development team to implement the new model and ensure that it is properly integrated into the existing organization model.

4. **Implement the Changes**: After planning the integration, the next step is to implement the changes. This involves updating the existing organization model to incorporate the new model, making any necessary adjustments to processes, workflows, and organizational structures, and ensuring that all stakeholders are trained on the new model. It is important to monitor the implementation process closely to identify any issues or challenges that may arise and address them promptly. 

5. **Evaluate and Refine**: After the new model has been implemented, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness and make any necessary refinements. This involves gathering feedback from stakeholders, analyzing performance metrics, and making adjustments as needed to ensure that the new model is functioning as intended and delivering the desired outcomes. Continuous improvement is a key aspect of the EDP framework, so it is important to regularly assess the effectiveness of the new model and make adjustments as needed to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the organization.
By following these steps, organizations can effectively merge new models into existing organization models while minimizing disruption and maximizing the benefits of the new model. It is important to approach the integration process with a clear plan, effective communication, and a focus on continuous improvement to ensure a successful outcome.
