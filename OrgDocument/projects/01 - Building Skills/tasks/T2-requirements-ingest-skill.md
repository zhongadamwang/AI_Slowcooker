**State:** completed  
**Labels:** feature, core-skill, phase1  
**Assignees:** adam.wang  
**Milestone:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Skills  
**Priority:** High
**Issue Number:** #T2
**Estimated Effort:** 2.0 days
**Actual Effort:** 2.0 days ✅

## Description
Implement the Requirements.Ingest skill that processes requirements from markdown input into a structured, normalized format. This skill serves as the entry point for all requirement analysis workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Processes markdown requirements input into structured format
- [x] Normalizes requirements with consistent categorization
- [x] Maintains traceability links to original source content
- [x] Produces standardized JSON output for downstream skills (confirmed acceptable)
- [x] Handles various requirement input formats and structures
- [x] Integrates seamlessly with VS Code markdown workflow

## Tasks
- [x] Design structured requirements schema for JSON output (updated for modern LLM capabilities)
- [x] Implement markdown parsing and normalization logic
- [x] Create requirement categorization and classification system
- [x] Build traceability link generation mechanism
- [x] Test with diverse sample requirements documents
- [x] Document skill usage patterns and input format guidelines
- [x] Optimize token limits for modern LLMs (400-600 tokens vs original 200)
- [x] Clarify output destinations (stdout for scripts, direct return for Copilot)

### Final Review - February 8, 2026  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** with enhancements ✅ **ALIGNED TO SOURCE REQUIREMENTS**

**✅ SOURCE ALIGNMENT COMPLETED**:
1. **Output Format**: ✅ **FIXED - Now matches original specification**
   - **PRIMARY**: Markdown table format as specified in [AI Agent Skillpack](../artifacts/Requirements/AI%20Agent%20Skillpack%20—%20Task%20Planning%20Assistant.md)
   - **SECONDARY**: JSON format for machine processing (dual output implemented)
   - Creates: requirements.md (primary), requirements.json (secondary)

2. **Architecture Compliance**: ✅ **ALIGNED** 
   - **Markdown-first approach** per original specification
   - **Downstream skills consume requirements.md** following original design
   - **VS Code/Claude Code integration** preserved

**Original Questions Answered**:
1. **Output Destination**: ✅ **ENHANCED**
   - **NEW**: Structured folder output to `outputs/projects/{project_id}/` 
   - **PRIMARY**: requirements.md (Markdown for downstream skills)  
   - **SECONDARY**: requirements.json (JSON for machine processing)
   - Auto-creates project directories with versioning support

2. **Token Limits**: ✅ **OPTIMIZED**
   - **Previous**: 200 tokens (~150 words) - too conservative
   - **Updated**: 400-600 tokens (~300-450 words) - optimized for modern LLMs
   - **Principle**: Focus on atomic requirements (one verifiable requirement per chunk)

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ **Source Requirements Compliance**: Now matches original AI Agent Skillpack specification
- ✅ **Dual Format Output**: Markdown (primary) + JSON (secondary) for best of both worlds  
- ✅ **Architecture Alignment**: Follows original markdown-centric design
- ✅ **Enhanced File Output**: Proper folder hierarchy for downstream processing
- ✅ **Comprehensive audit trails**: Processing logs and metadata
- ✅ **Versioning Support**: Automatic backup of previous outputs
- ✅ **Modern LLM optimization**: Enhanced token limits for current AI capabilities

**✅ VERIFIED OUTPUT STRUCTURE** (Aligned with Organizational Model):
```
outputs/projects/{project_id}/
└── Analysis/                # 🎯 Aligned with organizational structure
