## Description
Create the Plan.EstimateEffort skill that provides effort estimates for derived tasks using multiple estimation methods and historical data patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Estimates effort for development tasks using multiple methods
- [ ] Applies PERT (optimistic/most likely/pessimistic) estimation
- [ ] Considers task complexity, team experience, and technology factors
- [ ] Produces effort estimates with confidence levels
- [ ] Generates estimation documentation in markdown format
- [ ] Supports estimation calibration and historical learning

## Tasks
- [ ] Design multi-method effort estimation algorithms
- [ ] Implement PERT estimation logic with confidence intervals
- [ ] Create complexity and risk factor analysis capabilities
- [ ] Build estimation documentation and rationale generation
- [ ] Test estimation accuracy across different project types
- [ ] Document estimation methodologies and calibration strategies
