# Building Skills - MVP Project

## What We're Building

A **meta-development system** that creates and improves its own development procedures using AI agents.

### The Meta-Process
1. **Human** submits a development need
2. **AI Agent** analyzes and transforms it into actionable tasks  
3. **Human** reviews output and provides feedback
4. **AI Agent** incorporates feedback and improves
5. **System** evolves its own capabilities

### MVP Goal
Build the first working AI Agent that can:
- Analyze requirements input
- Generate structured outputs  
- Learn from human feedback
- Improve its own performance

### Why This Matters
This project builds the foundation for AI-assisted software development where the development process itself continuously evolves and improves.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Foundation Setup (75% complete)
- **Next**: Design first AI Agent architecture
- **Timeline**: 3-week MVP delivery target
