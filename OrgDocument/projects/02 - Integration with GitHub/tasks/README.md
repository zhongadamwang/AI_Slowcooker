# Tasks Folder - Integration with GitHub

This folder contains individual task files formatted as GitHub issues to enable seamless integration with GitHub's issue tracking system.

## Workflow

### Creating Tasks
1. Create new task files using the naming convention: `T##-task-name.md` (aligned with project plan)
2. Use the GitHub issue format with all required fields
3. Include clear acceptance criteria and task breakdowns
4. Reference dependencies using T## task numbers from project plan

### GitHub Integration
1. **Import to GitHub**: Task files can be bulk imported to GitHub Issues
2. **Team Collaboration**: Team members add feedback as issue comments in GitHub
3. **Export from GitHub**: Updated issues with comments can be exported back to update project documents
4. **Sync Process**: Regular sync between local task files and GitHub issues maintains consistency

## Project Phases and Tasks

### Phase 1: Requirements and Analysis
**Status**: Planning
**Timeline**: TBD

- **T2**: GitHub API Capabilities Assessment - Evaluate available GitHub APIs and integration points
- **T3**: Integration Architecture Design - Design technical architecture for GitHub integration
- **T4**: Risk Analysis and Mitigation Planning - Identify and plan for project risks
- **T5**: Technical Feasibility Study - Validate technical approach and identify constraints

### Phase 2: Core Integration Development
**Status**: Future
**Timeline**: TBD

- Core GitHub Issues synchronization
- Repository management automation
- Basic pull request workflow enhancement
- Authentication and security implementation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Status**: Future
**Timeline**: TBD

- GitHub Projects integration
- Advanced workflow automation
- Team collaboration tools
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
**Status**: Future
**Timeline**: TBD

- Integration testing
- User acceptance testing
- Documentation completion
- Deployment and rollout

## Task Management Guidelines

### Task File Format
Each task should include:
- Clear title and description
- Acceptance criteria
- Task breakdown (if complex)
- Dependencies and relationships
- Time estimates
- Priority and labels
- Assignee information (when applicable)

### Status Tracking
- **Not Started**: Task created but work has not begun
- **In Progress**: Active development or analysis
- **Review**: Completed and awaiting review
- **Testing**: In testing phase
- **Done**: Completed and validated
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies or external factors

## Integration Notes
This task management follows the same patterns established in PRJ-01 (Building Skills) with enhancements specific to GitHub integration workflows.
