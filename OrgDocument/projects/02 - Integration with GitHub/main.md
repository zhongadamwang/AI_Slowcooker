# 02 - Integration with GitHub

## Overview
This project's goal is to develop GitHub integration capabilities for enhanced collaboration workflows. The project focuses on building seamless integration between organizational development processes and GitHub's platform features, enabling better team collaboration, issue tracking, and project management.

## Structure
- `artifacts/` - Supporting materials and analysis outputs
  - `Requirements/` - Project requirements and specifications
  - `Analysis/` - Technical analysis documents
  - `Changes/` - Requirements change requests and tracking
  - `Sample Data/` - Test data and examples
  - `Testing/` - Integration testing and validation
- `tasks/` - Individual task files in GitHub issue format
  - Task files can be imported to GitHub Issues for team collaboration
  - Feedback added as issue comments in GitHub
  - Issues can be exported from GitHub to update project documents

## Key Documents
- [Initial Requirements](artifacts/Requirements/initial-requirements.md) - Project scope and high-level requirements
- [Project Plan](project-plan.md) - Detailed project planning with timeline and deliverables
- [Tasks Folder](tasks/) - Individual task files in GitHub issue format for team collaboration
- [Changes Management](artifacts/Changes/) - Requirements change tracking and documentation  
- [Analysis artifacts (artifacts/Analysis/)](artifacts/Analysis/) - Technical analysis documents

## Project Scope
**Core Objective**: Build robust GitHub integration capabilities that enhance collaboration workflows and enable seamless bidirectional synchronization between local project documents and GitHub platform features.
