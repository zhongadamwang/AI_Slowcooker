## Test Case Categories

### Functional Tests
Verify that individual process components work as designed.

### Process Tests
Validate that workflow sequences operate correctly.

### Data Tests
Ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the process.

### Integration Tests
Confirm that different process components work together properly.

### End-to-End Tests
Validate complete process scenarios from start to finish.

## Test Case Status Definitions
