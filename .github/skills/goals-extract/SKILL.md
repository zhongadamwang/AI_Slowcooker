# Goals Extract Skill

## Intent
Derive the business goal, success criteria, constraints, and KPIs from requirements input.

## Inputs
- **Source**: `projects/[project-name]/artifacts/Analysis/requirements.json` (generated by requirements-ingest skill)
- **Format**: Structured requirements data with IDs and sections for traceability

## Outputs
**Files Generated:**
- `projects/[project-name]/artifacts/Analysis/goals.json` - Structured data for programmatic use
- `projects/[project-name]/artifacts/Analysis/goals.md` - Human-readable documentation

### JSON Structure (`goals.json`)
```json
{
  "goal_statement": "string",
  "success_criteria": [
    {
      "criteria": "string",
      "source_refs": ["req_id:section"]
    }
  ],
  "kpis": [
    {
      "kpi": "string", 
      "source_refs": ["req_id:section"]
    }

### Markdown Structure (`goals.md`)
```markdown
# Goals Analysis

## Business Goal
[Goal statement with inline reference links]

## Success Criteria
- [Criteria 1] *(Ref: req_id:section)*
- [Criteria 2] *(Ref: req_id:section)*

## Key Performance Indicators
- [KPI 1] *(Ref: req_id:section)*
- [KPI 2] *(Ref: req_id:section)*

## Constraints
- [Constraint 1] *(Ref: req_id:section)*
- [Constraint 2] *(Ref: req_id:section)*

## Assumptions
- [Assumption 1] *(Ref: req_id:section)*
- [Assumption 2] *(Ref: req_id:section)*

## Open Questions
- [Question 1] *(Ref: req_id:section)*
- [Question 2] *(Ref: req_id:section)*

---
**Traceability:** Extracted from requirements: [req_id_1], [req_id_2]  
**Generated:** [timestamp]
```

## Tools
- JSON parser to read requirements.json from Analysis folder
- LLM with goal extraction prompt
- Glossary lookup to normalize terms
- File writer for dual output format (JSON + Markdown)

## Prompt Stub
Read the requirements.json file from the Analysis folder and extract goals, success criteria, KPIs, constraints, assumptions, and open questions. For each extracted item, maintain precise traceability by recording the source requirement ID and section from the JSON structure. Summarize the business goal in one sentence. Generate both goals.json and goals.md files with complete source references and confidence scores.

## Quality
- Enforce SMART wording on KPIs where possible (target, unit, timeframe)

## Example Output
